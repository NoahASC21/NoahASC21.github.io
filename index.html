        <h1>What is Akino Bot about?</h1>
        <p>Priconne Bot is a discord bot that allows you to look up data of units in Princess Connect! Re:Dive at their max stats, so you know what to expect when leveling them up. This also goes for the bosses that have been shown in the game as well, seeing the skills they have and their Union Burst as to what they both do.</p>

        <h1>Clan Battles</h1>
        <p>It's tough not knowing what units to use best for clan battle, or to not know what bosses are up next to prepare. That's why we decided to add this function to Priconne Bot!<br>Using this command for Clan Battles, you can bring up a list of what bosses to expect for the next clan battle, that being their health, their skills and Union Bursts</p>
